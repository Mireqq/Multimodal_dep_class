This repository hosts a real-time multimodal depression severity classifier web system that leverages both audio and text data for highly accurate classification. Using advanced deep learning models—Wav2Vec2 for audio and DeepSeek-LLaMA for text—combined through cross-attention and late fusion techniques, the system achieves over 99% accuracy, outperforming unimodal approaches by about 10%. The backend is built with Flask and RESTful APIs, containerized with Docker, and deployed on Hugging Face Spaces for efficient, low-latency inference. It ensures strict privacy compliance with GDPR and HIPAA through secure HTTPS and encrypted data handling. The project includes automated CI/CD pipelines for streamlined updates and thorough technical documentation to facilitate reproducibility and collaboration. Key technologies used are Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face, and modern web development tools.
